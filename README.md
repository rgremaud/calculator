Building a calculator for TOP
Plan is to manage almost everything with javascript 

HTML
    Barebones div creation for top calculator container

CSS
    Setting display settings for very highlevel items

Javascript:
    Create math functions - Each function should have two number inputs with their own operators included:
        add - A + b
        subtract - A - B
        multiply - A * B
        divide - A / B

Steps of a calculation:
Each calculator action has three variables: number, operator, number (Ex 3 + 5). 
    1 - User inputs first number
    2 - User selections operator (add, subtract, multiple, divide)
    3 - User inputs second number
    4 - Next button press returns the value, UNLESS CLEARED.  
        Scenarios:
        a) 3 + 5 = 8
        b) 3 + 5 + 10 - Returns 8 when + is selected a second time
        c) Clear - Resets

Complex JS tasks to accomplish:
    Button press displays the number on the calculator (click event modifiers)
